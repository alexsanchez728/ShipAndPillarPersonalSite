# Ship and Pillar Personal Site
Experimenting with THREE.js r91 which builds on WebGL to build my personal website.


GOALS:
- [x] A main character or object flying around the scene
- [x] A main camera circling a center focal point
- [x] Use lights, shadows, and fog to build atmosphere
- [x] Simple user interaction (in this project that means being able to click to rotate the camera)
- [ ] Build a ship out of primative shapes to be our character
- [ ] incorporate particle system to make the ship emit smoke as exhaust
- [ ] Create something to give the illusion the flying over a landscape
